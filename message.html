                <p>Dear Yumin, <br>
                Happy Birthday! Yay, you finally made it! 18 years... wow, that basically makes you an old lady. By the way, I'm typing this out too beacuse my handwriting is more crap than it already is because I stopped writing after school finished. HOORAY! You've finally become an adult now! I remember it was only 5 months ago that I thought you were really weird. And I still do... but in the best way possible. What other kind of dumbass would go with me (another dumbass) to the Math Team Party with a bunch of goddamn freshmen? Or sign up for CANTstruction with me to troll around? Yumin, you're funny and hilarious. You're not scared to make a fool out of yourself, so you're open to a lot of new things (and even more dumbass ideas). You're talented in a lot of random activities (like how the hell do you still type faster than me?). And you especially have a way with words (my favorite is "foolish bean head"). Also, you're really pretty. I know it took a while for us to get here, but look where we are now! I think Jesus wanted it to happen this way. Yumin, Avocadho, Tomato Eater, Gonzales Bean, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!
